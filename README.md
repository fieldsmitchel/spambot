#Synopsis

spambot is a Twitch.tv chatbot for channel administration and chat interaction written in the D programming language as a way to explore the features of D, implement multithreading in a and experiment with the Twitch IRC and HTTP APIs. The name of the bot comes from an inside joke in the Twitch communities I am a part of.

##Installation

Currently, the only way to get the bot is to compile the source manually, as it is still largely in flux.
